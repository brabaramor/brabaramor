### Hello dev world! 👋

First of all, my pronouns are she/her (in Portuguese: ela/dela) 

📚 Yes, I have a Linguistics & Literature bachelor degree. When I was a teenager I thought I wasn't into Exact Sciences - but I was too young to get to know that my love by learning HTML, or what was called "web design" at that moment (2010s, in Brazil, at least), was about exact sciences - so I started my humanities degree studies.
😆 The funny part? Now, 10 years later, I think I like patterns and then I know that I like both: humanities and exact science. I mean, linguistics and coding have a lot in common. Both are about knowing synthax of a language. Synthax is a magic world: you can understand humanities and math because of it.

🌱 I’m currently learning system and web development at UNISINOS university. I'm working professionally as a developer intern. It's been great doing it at all, because my best quality is that I love to study in all its meaning: take courses, read and pratice and do practical challenges, and I understand only the job routine would give me the best experience on development.

✍️ I'm currently doing a Database Administrator course at IF-RS (Instituto Federal do Rio Grande do Sul), because I did the Database Fundaments course at IF-RS and at the university and I really liked learning about that. 

🖥️ So far, I've coded some lines in markup, style sheet and programming languages like these and also in SQL tools:

저는 한국어 조금 말합니다. 왜냐면 나는 13살 때부터 오늘까지 케이팝을 너어어어무 좋아합니다!
